## Introduction

This project is a React-based messaging application created as part of the WEB101 Practical Assignment 1. The goal was to recreate a messaging interface from an existing application using React's component-based architecture.

### Implementation

#### 1. Component-Based Structure: 
The messaging app was broken down into multiple reusable components, such as Avatar.js, ChatList.js, ChatView.js, and others.

#### 2. File Organization: 
Each feature of the application was structured into different JavaScript files for better maintainability and reusability.

#### 3. Data Handling: 
A set of message data was used to populate the chat interface.

#### 4. Fetching Images: 
Profile pictures were fetched from a URL to simulate dynamic content.

#### 5. Styling & Interaction: 
Ensured proper UI/UX by applying CSS styles and necessary interactive elements.


### Conclusion 

This project shows how React.js can be used to build a well-structured and interactive messaging app. By creating reusable components and handling data dynamically, the app works smoothly and is easy to use.
